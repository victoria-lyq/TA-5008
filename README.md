# TA-5008-HW10-resolution

Here is a recursive algorithm for visiting all the nodes of a graph. Many of you implemented the traversal through looping through the graph's dll from its head to tail. In this example, we not only visited all nodes in a graph, but also iteratively transitions from the current node to an adjacent, unvisited node, until it can no longer find an unexplored node to transition to from its current location.
